# Tips for Buying Gold Jewellery & Understanding Hallmarking 👑

Planning to buy gold jewellery? Here’s a quick guide to avoid common mistakes.

## ✅ Must-Check Before You Buy

1. **Hallmark Certification**
   - Look for BIS hallmark on every piece
   - It confirms purity (22K, 18K, etc.)

2. **Making Charges**
   - Can be 3–25% of the gold value
   - Negotiate if possible or go for fixed-rate shops

3. **Purity Level**
   - 24K = 99.9% pure (soft, used in coins/bars)
   - 22K = 91.6% pure (best for jewellery)
   - 18K = 75% pure (used for diamond settings)

## 💡 Bonus Tips

- Always weigh the jewellery and verify the final bill
- Ask for proper invoice and certificate
- Avoid buying solely based on design; check metal value

## 📍 In Kerala?

Kerala has many trusted jewellers, but hallmarking awareness is still growing. Always double-check.
