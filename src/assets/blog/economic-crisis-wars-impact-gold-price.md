When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military strike against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, global stock markets panicked. Major indices reported historic intraday falls amid the uncertainty.

Back in India, a bloodbath on Dalal Street followed alongside a weakening Rupee. This was reported to be one of the biggest falls since the COVID pandemic‚Äôs onset. Amidst this chaos, gold prices in India showed a sharp uptick.

Gold has been traded across the world for eons, even before formal financial systems existed. It is a secure, liquid, and movable asset. Its rarity ensures that its price has only appreciated over time. This is why even the most conservative investors include gold in their portfolios.

## The Russia-Ukraine War Impact üåç

This sharp rise was driven by:

- Concerns of an economic slowdown
- High inflation
- Spiking global gold prices

Sanctions on Russia, disruption in commodities‚Äô supply, and interruptions in the global supply chain added fuel to the fire.

## Impact of a Crisis on Gold Prices üè¶

Gold has always been seen as the safest investment. Even a small disturbance in the global market triggers a rise in gold prices. 

Here‚Äôs what usually happens:

- **Natural disasters, wars, or economic crises** ‚Üí increase uncertainty.
- **Investors seek safe haven assets** ‚Üí gold demand rises.
- **High demand + limited supply** ‚Üí price of gold surges.

Gold is a *safe haven asset* ‚Äì its value typically grows in market turbulence. Investors turn to gold to reduce their exposure to risky assets like equities or bonds.

When the stock market tanks, demand for gold shoots up. This inverse relationship drives gold prices higher globally.
