## 🔍 Factors Behind the Gold Price Surge

### 📊 1. Demand and Supply Dynamics

- Gold is scarce. That makes it precious.
- When more people buy it — especially during **weddings or economic crises** — prices spike.
- Supply depends mostly on mining, and production has limits.

### 🔐 2. Inflation Hedge

- When **inflation rises**, the value of paper currency drops.
- Investors rush to gold as it retains purchasing power.
- Think of gold like an umbrella in a financial storm.

### 💸 3. Interest Rate Influence

- Gold and interest rates often move in **opposite directions**.
- Lower rates make bank deposits less attractive, pushing people toward gold.
- But when interest rates rise, some investors shift away from gold.

### 🪔 4. Cultural and Seasonal Demand

- In Kerala, gold is not just an asset — it is tradition.
- During **Onam, Vishu, and weddings**, gold demand surges.
- This seasonal buying spree affects prices every year.

### 🏛️ 5. Government Actions and Gold Reserves

- Central banks and governments also buy gold.
- Their buying/selling affects global prices.
- For example, if the **RBI buys more gold**, prices could increase.

### 💵 6. US Dollar Movements

- Gold is priced in US Dollars globally.
- If the dollar weakens, gold becomes cheaper for other currencies — and demand rises.
- Conversely, a strong dollar makes gold expensive and may lower its price.
