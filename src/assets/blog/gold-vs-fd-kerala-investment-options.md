## 🌟 Gold as an Investment

In Kerala, gold is not just a metal—it is tradition, culture, and a sign of prosperity. Gold has always been a trusted investment choice, especially during festivals like Akshaya Tritiya and Dhanteras.

- **Liquidity**: Physical gold is easy to buy and sell at local jewellery shops. Digital gold, ETFs, and sovereign gold bonds offer flexible options without the need to store jewellery.
- **Portfolio Protection**: Gold helps reduce overall risk in your investments. Experts suggest allocating 10-15% of your portfolio to gold.
- **Loan Facility**: Many banks and NBFCs offer loans against gold with low interest rates.

## 💰 Fixed Deposit (FD) Investments

FDs are a go-to investment for risk-averse individuals. They offer fixed interest returns for a set tenure.

- **Predictable Returns**: Banks set the interest rate at the time of deposit. Senior citizens enjoy higher rates, up to 0.75% more.
- **Disciplined Savings**: FDs encourage regular saving habits.
- **Taxation**: Interest earned is taxable, based on your income tax slab.

## ⚖️ Gold vs FD: A Detailed Comparison

### 1️⃣ Risks Involved

- **Gold**: Prone to short-term volatility but acts as a hedge against inflation and currency erosion.
- **FD**: Virtually risk-free with guaranteed returns.

### 2️⃣ Rate of Return

- **Gold**: Historical CAGR of 9.8% over 30 years. In the last five years, 17.9% returns during Dhanteras seasons. Returns depend on market conditions.
- **FD**: Average CAGR of 8%. Safe and steady.

### 3️⃣ Liquidity

- **Gold**: Can sell or pledge anytime for quick cash.
- **FD**: Premature withdrawals attract penalties. Some banks offer no-penalty exit FDs—check before investing.

### 4️⃣ Loan Against Investment

Both allow you to borrow up to 80-90% of the value.

📌 During the lockdown, RBI raised gold loan LTV to 90%. So, ₹1 lakh in gold can fetch a loan of ₹90,000—compared to ₹60,000-75,000 earlier.

### 5️⃣ Income vs Capital Gain

- **Gold**: Gains are classified as capital gains. Indexation benefits apply for long-term investments.
- **FD**: Interest is treated as income and taxed accordingly.
