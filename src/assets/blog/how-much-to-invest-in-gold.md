Gold has always glittered in Indian households, but how much of your investment portfolio should actually go into it? This post unpacks everything you need to know in a clear, simple way for Kerala’s gold-loving investors. ✨

## 💼 Why Portfolio Diversification Matters

A smart investment portfolio:
- Is diversified across different asset classes like stocks, gold, real estate, etc.
- Reduces risk from market fluctuations
- Focuses on long-term, sustainable returns

But over-diversification can also dilute returns. So where does gold fit in?

## 🪙 Gold as a Hedge, Not the Whole Game

Gold is a hedge against:
- Inflation
- Currency volatility
- Market crashes

During uncertain times, gold tends to rise when stocks fall. That is why many Kerala investors look at gold as a safety net rather than a growth engine.

## 📊 Real Returns: Gold vs. Equity

Let us crunch some numbers:

- ₹50,000 invested in **gold in 1990** → ~₹2.5 lakh today
- Same amount in **Sensex in 1990** → ~₹4 lakh today

Gold is safe, but equities have historically outperformed it. Still, gold’s low correlation with equities makes it valuable in a **balanced** portfolio.

## 📌 How Much Gold to Hold? 3 Smart Strategies

### 1. 💛 The 5–10% Strategy

If you:
- Trust the economy’s growth
- Want insurance against sudden crashes

➡ Allocate **5–10%** of your portfolio to gold or [digital gold options](https://goldpricekerala.in)

### 2. ⚖️ The 15–25% Strategy

If you:
- Are moderately cautious
- Believe inflation might rise
- Want protection but not panic

➡ Go for **15–25%** gold allocation

### 3. 🚨 The 30–50% Strategy

If you:
- Are very skeptical about the economic outlook
- Expect a financial crisis or currency collapse

➡ You might go for **30–50%**, but rebalance yearly. Too much gold = missed growth opportunities.
