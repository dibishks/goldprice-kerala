## ✨ Jewellery: Beauty With a Hidden Cost

## 💰 Gold Schemes: Saving for the Shining Metal

- Gold schemes are like mini SIPs run by jewellers.

- You deposit money monthly, and after a fixed period, you get to buy gold with that sum.

- These can be tempting, but the returns may not always beat inflation or FD rates.  

- 📌 Choose only trusted jewellers with transparent policies.

## 💻 Digital Gold: Click and Own

- Digital gold is one of the easiest ways to own gold today. Start with as little as ₹1.

- Platforms back it with real physical gold, but not every app lets you take delivery of the actual metal.
